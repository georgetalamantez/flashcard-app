    <h1>Chapter 3: Photosynthesis</h1>

    <h2>3.1 Overview of Photosynthesis</h2>
    <p>
        Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria
        convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose molecules.
        This process is essential for life on Earth as it produces oxygen and
        provides the foundation for most food chains.
    </p>

    <h2>3.2 The Photosynthesis Equation</h2>
    <p>
        The overall equation for photosynthesis is:
        6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂
    </p>
    <p>
        This means that carbon dioxide and water, in the presence of light energy,
        produce glucose and oxygen.
    </p>

    <h2>3.3 Light-Dependent Reactions</h2>
    <p>
        Light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts.
        These reactions capture light energy and convert it into chemical energy
        in the form of ATP and NADPH. Water molecules are split, releasing oxygen
        as a byproduct.
    </p>

    <h3>3.3.1 Photosystems</h3>
    <p>
        Two photosystems work together: Photosystem II and Photosystem I.
        Photosystem II absorbs light at 680nm, while Photosystem I absorbs
        light at 700nm. These photosystems work in sequence to produce ATP and NADPH.
    </p>

    <h2>3.4 Light-Independent Reactions (Calvin Cycle)</h2>
    <p>
        The Calvin Cycle occurs in the stroma of chloroplasts and uses ATP and NADPH
        from the light-dependent reactions to fix carbon dioxide into glucose.
        This process does not require light directly, hence "light-independent."
    </p>

    <h3>3.4.1 Stages of the Calvin Cycle</h3>
    <p>
        The Calvin Cycle consists of three main stages:
        1. Carbon Fixation - CO₂ combines with RuBP
        2. Reduction - 3-PGA is reduced to G3P using ATP and NADPH
        3. Regeneration - RuBP is regenerated from G3P
    </p>

    <h2>3.5 Factors Affecting Photosynthesis</h2>
    <p>
        Several factors influence the rate of photosynthesis:
    </p>
    <p>
        Light Intensity: Higher light intensity generally increases photosynthesis
        rate until a saturation point is reached.
    </p>
    <p>
        Carbon Dioxide Concentration: Increased CO₂ levels can enhance photosynthesis
        up to a certain point.
    </p>
    <p>
        Temperature: Photosynthesis has an optimal temperature range, typically
        between 25-35°C for most plants.
    </p>
    <p>
        Water Availability: Adequate water is essential for photosynthesis, as it
        is a reactant and helps maintain cell turgor.
    </p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        Photosynthesis is a complex process that sustains life on Earth by converting
        solar energy into chemical energy. Understanding its mechanisms helps us
        appreciate the interconnection between plants and all other living organisms.
